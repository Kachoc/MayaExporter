# MayaExporter
A plugin for [Autodesk Maya Â®](https://www.autodesk.fr/products/maya/overview)
to export 3D models in a custom format, and that I developed as a high-school
student. It was supposed to be used in conjunction with my personal
[real-time 3D rendering engine](https://github.com/Kachoc/CrowdEngine).
